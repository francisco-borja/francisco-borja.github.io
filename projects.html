            <h2>BI Project - Data Integration and Data Visualization for the calculation and Analysis of Delivery Costs</h2>
            <p>This project involved calculating the shipping costs of thousands of deliveries for one of my clients and displaying them in an easy to read Looker Studio Dashboard that would refresh daily. 

The big problem that the customer company had was that they had independent information in different data sources and formats and it was difficult for them to integrate the data to be able to calculate the actual shipping cost.. For example, the data about sales and order fulfillments was in a No-SQL database, the data  about product warehouse allocation in another No-SQL database and  the information about the shipping costs was store in tens of  different files in different formats (most of them excel, csv or google sheets) containing the invoice amounts for each delivery. 

So to be able to consolidate the data and to calculate the shipping costs for the company.I created a fully comprehensive Business Intelligence solution that handled every aspect from Data Engineering to Data Visualization.
