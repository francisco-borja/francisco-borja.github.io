            <img src="BORJA_Francisco.JPG" alt="Your Photo" class="profile-photo"> 
            <p>

I am a Business Intelligence Analyst and a  Data Engineer from Quito, Ecuador. With over nine years of international experience, I have led and successfully implemented numerous Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics projects across Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, and the United States, consistently delivering impactful outcomes.
</p>
  <p>

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Business Intelligence and have held important positions at global organizations, including the United Nations, and as a consultant for companies in Ecuador, US and Spain. Additionally, I served as a Data Analysis Professor in my country, further solidifying my expertise in the field.
</p>
My technical proficiency encompasses advanced ETL, SQL, and Python programming, enabling me to expertly extract, transform, and integrate data from diverse sources. My skill set also includes significant expertise in various BI tools for visualization such as Google Looker Studio and Power BI, which complements my ability to translate complex business problems and technical solutions into clear, actionable reports and dashboards for business users.

In recent years, I have extended my role beyond data engineering and visual analytics to include deep analysis through the use of Machine Learning techniques and strategic business recommendations. These contributions have led to the implementation of new tactics and strategies that generated substantial positive results for the companies I worked with. 

In this website you can check out muy portfolio with some examples of some of the projects I have worked on the recent years.
