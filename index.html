            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Business Intelligence Analyst and Data Engineer from Quito, Ecuador, with over nine years of international experience. I have led and successfully implemented numerous BI and Analytics projects across Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, and the United States.
            I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Business Intelligence and have held positions at global organizations, including the United Nations. I've also served as a Data Analysis Professor in Ecuador, demonstrating my expertise in the field.
            My technical proficiency includes advanced ETL, SQL, and Python programming, as well as expertise in BI tools like Google Looker Studio and Power BI.
            In recent years, my role has expanded to include Machine Learning techniques and strategic business recommendations, leading to significant positive results for the companies I've worked with.
