            <h2>BI Project - Estimate of days left of stock by Product for product supply (based on average recent sales)</h2>
            <p>This project involved estimating the duration for which the current stock of each product would last across various warehouses based on the integration of  historic sales, incoming PO quantities, current stock, among others. The program updates data once a day and the results are displayed in an easy to read Google Sheet.</p>

            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>The customer company was experiencing significant issues in inventory and purchasing management, where the existing system failed to integrate a full spectrum of critical factors including sales, pre-orders, and incoming quantities from purchase orders (POs). This inadequacy led to substantial financial losses for the customer company, primarily due to frequent order cancellations resulting from delivery delays. Furthermore, the inability to maintain adequate stock levels of popular products exacerbated the situation, preventing the company from capitalizing on potential sales opportunities. The need for a robust inventory management solution was evident to ensure optimal stock availability and improve overall operational efficiency.
</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
            <p>The duration of stock was calculated using several key factors: monthly sales per product across different U.S. states, current stock quantities at each warehouse, incoming product quantities from purchase orders (POs), and pre-order quantities for each product. By integrating past sales data with current stock levels and expected future supplies (from POs and pre-orders), the project provided a robust framework to predict how long the stock of each product would last, facilitating more informed purchasing decisions. The estimated duration of stock by each product results were presented in an easy-to-read Google Sheet that was  updated daily.
