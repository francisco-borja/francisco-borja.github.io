            <h2>BI Project - Data Integration and Data Visualization for the Calculation and Analysis of Delivery Costs</h2>
            <p>This project involved the data integration of multiple data sources for calculating the delivery costs for one of my clients and displaying them in an easy to read Looker Studio Dashboard that would update data daily.</p>
            <img src="\Data Analytics Portfolio\ETL for Multiple Data Source Integration for calculation of Shipping Costs\Delivery Costs dashboard image.jpg" alt="Dashboard Preview" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:20px auto;">

            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>The major issue faced by the customer company was that they had independent information in different data sources and formats, making it difficult to integrate the data to calculate the actual shipping costs. For instance, the data about sales and order fulfillments was in a No-SQL database, the data about product warehouse allocation in another No-SQL database, and the information about shipping costs was stored in tens of different files in various formats (mostly Excel, CSV, or Google Sheets) containing the invoice amounts for each delivery.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
            <p>To resolve this issue, I created a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution that handled every aspect from Data Engineering to Data Visualization. This solution enabled the consolidation of scattered data in different formats and efficiently calculated the shipping costs for the company. The end result was a dashboard in Looker Studio that clearly presented the costs and updated daily, thus providing a valuable tool for the companyâ€™s strategic decision-making.</p>
