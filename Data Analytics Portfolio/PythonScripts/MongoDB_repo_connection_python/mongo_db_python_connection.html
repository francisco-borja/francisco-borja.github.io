            <h2>Mongo DB connection to No SQL repository and Data Extraction with Python</h2>
            <p>This program was created with the goal of connecting to a MongoDB repository (NoSQL database) and being able to extract the data using Mongo DB Pipeline/aggregation language, for subsequent manipulation.</p>

            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>The company had a repository in MongoDB containing data previously extracted from Shopify via an API; however, these data were not being used for any analysis. In this case, the company wanted to start using their data to turn it into useful information for decision-making. The first step was naturally to connect to MongoDB and successfully extract the data.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
            <p>A Python program was created in a Jupyter Notebook. This program enabled the successful connection and data extraction from the MongoDB repository. Below, we describe the steps the program executes: The Jupyter Notebook connects to Google Drive to securely retrieve the connection string, then connects to the MongoDB repository, sends a request to get the data, and then uses MongoDB pipeline queries to obtain the necessary data from the resulting MongoDB response. Finally, it converts this data into a Python DataFrame.</p>
            
            <h3>Tools Involved</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mongo DB</li>
                <li>Mongo DB pipelines/aggregations</li>
                <li>python</li>
                           </ul>
