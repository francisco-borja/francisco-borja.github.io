            <h2>BI Project - Geospatial Analysis of Sales Data in Looker Studio</h2>
            <p>The project aimed to create a map in Looker Studio that makes it very easy to view how many orders have been sold per each US zip code, city, and state. The report also allows the user to understand the potential opportunity for sales by zip code, city, and state, as it includes total population and other demographic information. With information such as the total quantity of orders and the populations by zip code, it was possible to create metrics like “orders per 10K inhabitants” and the “percentage of zip codes reached.” This enables commercial stakeholders to easily identify which zip codes, cities, or states represent good opportunities for commercial efforts.</p>

            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>The challenge was in effectively visualizing and interpreting the sales data spread across different geographical locations. There was a need to integrate various data sources that included sales, population statistics, and other demographic data to provide a comprehensive overview of the market penetration and areas of opportunity.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
            <p>By leveraging the capabilities of Looker Studio, we developed an interactive map that displays data dynamically based on user selections. The map includes detailed overlays of sales per 10,000 inhabitants and highlights areas with untapped potential, allowing for strategic planning and targeted marketing initiatives.</p>
