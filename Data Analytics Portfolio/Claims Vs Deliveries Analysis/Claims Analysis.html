            <h2>BI Project-Data Integration and Data Visualization for the Analysis of Product Claims/Warranties</h2>
            <p>This project streamlined the correlation of claims and delivery data by integrating multiple sources into a centralized database. Key insights were displayed on an easy-to-read Looker Studio Dashboard that updated daily, enhancing the ability to track and address delivery or product quality issues efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>The company faced a challenge with its warranty data management, as it had numerous warranty files scattered across different Google Sheets, each formatted differently. Additionally, information about deliveries—categorized by product and delivery company—was stored in separate files. The company needed to better understand customer claims by correlating the total number of claims with the total deliveries for each product and delivery company. The primary goal was to identify specific products or delivery companies that had significantly higher rates of claims, enabling the company to pinpoint and address the underlying causes effectively.
</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
            <p>We designed and implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) program to streamline data management. This program efficiently extracted data from various warranty and delivery files, then standardized and consolidated this information into a centralized database. To facilitate easy analysis and decision-making, we connected this database to a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard prominently displayed key metrics, allowing for the easy identification of specific products or delivery companies that exhibited significantly higher rates of claims. This integration and visualization greatly improved the company ability to pinpoint and address areas of concern, enhancing overall operational effectiveness.</p>
